# [Developer documentation](@id dev_docs)

!!! note "Contributing guidelines"
    If you haven't, please read the [Contributing guidelines](90-contributing.md) first.

If you want to make contributions to this package that involves code, then this guide is for you.

## First time clone

!!! tip "If you have writing rights"
    If you have writing rights, you don't have to fork. Instead, simply clone and skip ahead. Whenever **upstream** is mentioned, use **origin** instead.

If this is the first time you work with this repository, follow the instructions below to clone the repository.

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone your repo (this will create a `git remote` called `origin`)
3. Add this repo as a remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/rsenne/ParallelMCMC.jl
   ```

This will ensure that you have two remotes in your git: `origin` and `upstream`.
You will create branches and push to `origin`, and you will fetch and update your local `main` branch from `upstream`.

## Linting and formatting

Install a plugin on your editor to use [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org).
This will ensure that your editor is configured with important formatting settings.

We use [https://pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com) to run the linters and formatters.
In particular, the Julia code is formatted using [JuliaFormatter.jl](https://github.com/domluna/JuliaFormatter.jl), so please install it globally first:

```julia-repl
julia> # Press ]
pkg> activate
pkg> add JuliaFormatter
```

To install `pre-commit`, we recommend using [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io) as follows:

```bash
# Install pipx following the link
pipx install pre-commit
```

With `pre-commit` installed, activate it as a pre-commit hook:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

To run the linting and formatting manually, enter the command below:

```bash
pre-commit run -a
```

**Now, you can only commit if all the pre-commit tests pass**.

### Link checking locally

We use `lychee` for link checking in CI. You can run it locally to avoid waiting for CI. First, [install lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), then run against the repository root using the project config:

```bash
lychee --no-progress --config lychee.toml .
```

## Testing

As with most Julia packages, you can just open Julia in the repository folder, activate the environment, and run `test`:

```julia-repl
julia> # press ]
pkg> activate .
pkg> test
```

## Working on a new issue

We try to keep a linear history in this repo, so it is important to keep your branches up-to-date.

1. Fetch from the remote and fast-forward your local main

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git switch main
   git merge --ff-only upstream/main
   ```

2. Branch from `main` to address the issue (see below for naming)

   ```bash
   git switch -c 42-add-answer-universe
   ```

3. Push the new local branch to your personal remote repository

   ```bash
   git push -u origin 42-add-answer-universe
   ```

4. Create a pull request to merge your remote branch into the org main.

### Branch naming

- If there is an associated issue, add the issue number.
- If there is no associated issue, **and the changes are small**, add a prefix such as "typo", "hotfix", "small-refactor", according to the type of update.
- If the changes are not small and there is no associated issue, then create the issue first, so we can properly discuss the changes.
- Use dash separated imperative wording related to the issue (e.g., `14-add-tests`, `15-fix-model`, `16-remove-obsolete-files`).

### Commit message

- Use imperative or present tense, for instance: *Add feature* or *Fix bug*.
- Have informative titles.
- When necessary, add a body with details.
- If there are breaking changes, add the information to the commit message.

### Before creating a pull request

!!! tip "Atomic git commits"
    Try to create "atomic git commits" (recommended reading: [The Utopic Git History](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/the-utopic-git-history-d44b81c09593)).

- Make sure the tests pass.
- Make sure the pre-commit tests pass.
- Fetch any `main` updates from upstream and rebase your branch, if necessary:

  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git rebase upstream/main BRANCH_NAME
  ```

- Then you can open a pull request and work with the reviewer to address any issues.

## Building and viewing the documentation locally

The CI workflow builds docs from the `docs/` project after developing the current checkout into that environment. To match CI locally:

1. Instantiate the docs environment and develop the package into it:

   ```bash
   julia --project=docs -e '
     using Pkg
     Pkg.develop(Pkg.PackageSpec(path=pwd()))
     Pkg.instantiate()'
   ```

2. Build the docs once:

   ```bash
   julia --project=docs docs/make.jl
   ```

3. For live preview while editing, start a docs Julia session and serve it:

   ```bash
   julia --project=docs
   ```

   ```julia
   using LiveServer
   servedocs()
   ```

4. If you want the extra CI parity check, run the doctests too:

   ```bash
   julia --project=docs -e '
     using Documenter: DocMeta, doctest
     using ParallelMCMC
     DocMeta.setdocmeta!(ParallelMCMC, :DocTestSetup, :(using ParallelMCMC); recursive=true)
     doctest(ParallelMCMC)'
   ```

If you update the landing-page animation, regenerate it with:

```bash
julia docs/src/assets/make_julia_deer_gif.jl
```

## Making a new release

To create a new release:

1. Create a release branch such as `release-x.y.z`.
2. Update `version` in `Project.toml`.
3. Update any release-facing docs you want to ship with the tag.
4. Open and merge the release PR after CI passes.
5. Comment `@JuliaRegistrator register` on the merge commit or release PR, then wait for the registry PR and auto-merge.
6. After registration, verify that TagBot creates the GitHub tag and that the docs workflow updates the [stable docs](https://rsenne.github.io/ParallelMCMC.jl/stable).
